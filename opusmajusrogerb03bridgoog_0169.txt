p. 31. Capitulum xvh] This chapter is omitted by J. and V. It iscontained
however in a tract by Bacon found by Dr. Gasquet in the same volume as V.
(Vat. 4086, ff. 75-82), aud published by him in the Engl. Historieal Review (J uly
1897). Dr. Gasquet, while at first of opinion that this tract was a fragment of the
Opts Minus, arrived finally at the opinion that it was an independent summary or
introduction written expressly for the Opus Majm, and distinct alike from the
Opus Minus and the Opus Tertium.

I cannot but think that the first of those views is the better founded. That the
Opus Majus was accompanied by an epistola praecedens is certain. But Bacon’s
words in the beginning of Opus Tertium seem to show that the whole of the Opus
Minus or Opus Secundum (two titles repeatedly used in the Opus Tertium as
identical) was regarded by him as forming this preliminary letter. Aftera brief
reference to Opus Majus, he speaks (Ο. Τ. p. ς) of the necessity of an opuscule
which should indicate the general purport of the priucipal work. Velut intro*-
ductoriam volui mcundam parare scripturam. On p. 7 (of O. Τ.) he goes on to

. say, Primo igitur in Opere secundo ..... sub his verbis incepi perorare, Cum

tauta reverentiae dignitas etc. What follows in Ο. T.. quoted from Opus
Secundum or Minus, is almost identical for nearly six peges with the opening part
of Dr. Gasquet's fragment. It seems therefore that in any edition of Baeon's
complete works this tract should take its place as an addition or rather prefrx to
the fragmem of the Opus Minus edited by Brewer. The Opus Minus is expressly
designated by Bacon himself, in the citation from it given ino. T.. as epistola
praecum. In hac epistola praeeunte philosophorum sententias securius allegabo

ln any ease the fragment discovered by Dr. Gasquetis of great interest And
though nearly all that it contains has been repeated in the Opus Tertium, thereis
a sentence in it which throws a new light on Bacon's method of oomposition‚ and
which may help to explain many of the perplexities which confront his editors.
Senticns meam imbecillitatem nihil scribo difficile quod non transeat usque ad

sent perhaps two of these preliminary drafts ς J. differing materially from V., and
containing much (ag, pp. rao-5 of ιον. text) that V. omits. There are grounds
for thinking that 0., with all its imperfectioris and omissione, was copied from a
more finished draft than either J. or V.; and this may perhaps account for tlte
transposition of chapter xvi, which ih any case lits the place assigned to it in the
text.
