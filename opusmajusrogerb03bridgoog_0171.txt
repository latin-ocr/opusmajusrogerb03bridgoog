164 ADDITIONAL NOTES, VOL. l.

given in 0. Τ., cap. 23. ln V. most of this is given; omitting however Adam’s
keen rejoinder to eaptious questioners. Quando per tentationem et derisionem
aliqui Minores praesumptuosi quaesiverunt a fratre Adam, Quid est intellectus
agens? respondit, Corvus Eliaer volens per'hoc dicere quod fuit Deus vel angelus.
Sed noluit exprimere, quia tentando et non propter sapientiam quaesiverunt.

p. 4o.i ιι. istud est falsum] (Addition to note 1.) Nevertheless, neither
of the above errors is to be found in the Latin version of Aristotle printed with
Averroes‘ Commentary in Venice, 1495. This edition includes the Physics,
De Caelo, De Anima, and Meteorologica. Of the first three, two versions of
Aristotle are given. One of these ismade directlylrom the Greek, and corresponds
to the extracts numbered vii., x., xix. in Jourdain (pp. 405-18). The other
version is from the Arabia, corresponding to extracts v. and viii. of Jourdain. Of

the Meteorologica, only the Greco-Latin version is given. Thu is probably that
made by William of Moerbeka for Thomas Aquinas. ln this version Aristotle's
remark about the lunar rainbow is correctly translated ι In annis quinquaginta bis
comperimus solum. In the passage from de Caelo of which Bacon speaks, both
the GrecoLatin and the Arabico-Latin version are substantially accurate. The
version used by Albertus Magnus was also Arabico-Latin, but by another
translator, perhaps Michael Scotus. If we refer to his Commentary on the
Meteorologica, we shall find the error which Bacon denounces3 and it will be
seen that Albert had also rejected it. Albert observes, Dicit enim (Aristoteles)
quod non videtur iris lunae in quinquaginta annis nisi bis. But trustworthy
· observers, he says, had seen it twice in the same year. He himself had seen a
lunar rainbow when the moon was in the south and not quite full. He adds,
Puto ego quod istud Aristoteles recitaverit ex opinionibus aliorum, et non ex
veritate demonstrationis vel experimenti. Vincent of Beauvais and Bartholomew‚
the two principal encylopedists of the r3th century, perpetuate the error without
the correction. (See Albert, Meteon, lib. iii. Tract. 4. cap. 11 ed. Borgnet,
18913 Bartholom, De Proprietatibus, lib. xi. cap. ς, and Vincent. Belluac.
Speculum Naturale, lib. iv. cap. 79). In Ο. Τ. cap. 23 Bacon admits the
existence of other translations: aliae translationes habent aliter. (Cf. r. t.

ward by the Peripatetics, while, as Averroes says, knowing nothing of the matter
himself. (See Averroes’ Comun, f. 379band c, Venice, 1495.) See r. t. p. 52·
