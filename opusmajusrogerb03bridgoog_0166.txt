AnnrrrowAr NOTES, rom. 159

p. ci. Analysisof Part 111. lest line] add, (6) for conversion of the heethen, (7)
resistance to the enemies of Christendom. (Cf. rev. text, pp. 120- ς.)

p. r. Opus Majus] The title opus Maju's is not found in the work itself.
But as the treatise is continually spoken of by this name in the Opus Tertium
it is convenient to preserve it here. The heading here given to Pars Prima
is from Ο. In V. there are no rubrius. In J. nearly all of those in Part Ι. have
been destroyed ; we see however that the last of the four distinctiones began with
cap. xii. (rev. text, p. 26). 0. numbers the chapters consecutively without
reference to distinctiones.

p'. r. (note) epistolae praecedentis] lt seems clear that the reference is not to
the Pope's letter, but to the Opus Minus, or as Bacou frequently calls it opus
secundum or secunda scriptura, which as we lenrn from the opening sentences of
the Opus Tertium was conveyed to the Pope by the same messenger who was
charged with the opus Majus. See Ο. T. p. 5, in which this work is spoken of
as Introductoniz Scriptura. Further on (Ο. Τ. p. 7) along extract from it is
given, in the course of which (0. Τ. p. 9) it is spoken of as hac epr‘stola praeeunte.
(See also notes to p. rr. l. aand top. 31.)

p. 2. l. ¹4· Avicenna] Gundisalvi's translation of Avicenna’s Metaphysics‚
made at Toledo in the rzth century, was printed at Venice in 1498. The passage
cited will be found lib. ix. cap. 7.

p. 4. cap. ii. t 6. libro secundo epistolarum] Ο. has secundo; V. and J.
rightly secundarum. The ref. isto the 123rd letter (lib. xx. Ep. vi. ed. Haase).
The quotation is slightly condensed.

p. 6. l. 4. inpericulum ducit] This passage is corrected in the revised text.
0. V. and J. all have erudelitate, brt Adelard wrote credulitate.

p. 6. l. ς. aeternitate Dei] Thus 0.; brt V. and J. have aeternitate muudi.
The reference is probably to the work on this subject of Joannes Grammaticus
Philoponus‚ an Alexandrian writer of the 7th century. In the Latin translation of
it by Jean Mahot (Lyons ¹557) there is a passage (lib. vii. cap. κ) which is
perhaps the one here meant.

p. 6.L 8. Consuetudo est] The passage will be found as indicated ln the
Venice edition of 1495 of Averroes’ Commentary. In the edition of ¹552 it has
been shisted from the second book of the Physics into.the first.

p. st ¹5· opposita principiorum] See Averr. Corum. Met. lib. ii.‚ near the
end.
