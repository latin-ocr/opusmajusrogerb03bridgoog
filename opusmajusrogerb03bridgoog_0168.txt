Johannes Diaconos lived late in the oth century. There is no contemporary
authority ior the statement.

p. 20. l. 21. Parisius] The text shouldbe, Parisius diu luit contradictum naturali
philosophiae etmetaphysicaeAristotelisperAvicennametAverroem expositis. The
decree oi the Council of Paris on this subject will be found in Jourdain, pp. 189-90.
It enacted that the body ol Amaury oi Rennes should be disinterred and thrown
into unconsecrated ground: that a long list oi clergymeu should be degraded,
imprisoned, or handed over to the secular arm ; that the works of David ol Dinant
should be bumt; nec libri Aristotelis de naturali philosophia nec commenta
legantur Parisius publico vel secreto. In1215 Robert de Courpon, papal legate,
renewed the prohibition, expressly including the Metaphysics. In 1231 a bull oi
Gregorle. modified this decision. The prohibited books were not to be used
‘quousque examinati fuerint et ab omni errorum suspicione purgati!

p. 21. l. 7. infructuosa] J. and 0., infrunita: V., infinita.

p.21.l.13. utprius] p. 2.

p. 22. l. 22. etipse] Alter singulis eorum V. has quorum quatuor, which is
unintelligible. The reading in the text is that of Ο. In J. the passage is
destroyed. What Bacon seems to have meant is, ‘He is a match lor all oi them
in some things: in some points more than a match’

p. 24.l. ς. omnis sapientis] Here V. supplies words (see revised text, p. 25)
which are not very intelligible. ln J. they are nearly erased.

p. 24. l. 11. verisimile non esset] Here V. adds et sententiandis ignorantia
foedaretur. J. isimperfect, but ignorantia foedaret cau be deciphered. 'Sen-
tentiam should probably be supplied.

p. 24. l. 12. de virtutibus] cf. Sen. De remediis fortuitorum, cap. 7.

p. 24. l. 19. Capitulum xii] Here J. has the following rubric, the first that
” has been preserved 1 Distinctio quarta in qua ostenduntur causae quare sancti et
primitiva ecclesia non habuerunt usum scientiarum magnarum quae tunc (sic)
locum non haberit modo ut vitemus artium sapientialium magnalia licet vulgus hoc
faeiat allegans quod sancti doctores et ecclesia primitiva his non utebantur. The
substitution oi tamen ior tunc would make this intelligihle. Cf. rev. text, p. 26.

p. 25. l. 32. cum enim Hieronymus] For this correspondence see Aug. vol.
ii. (ed. Migne) Ep. lxvii, lxviii. and lxxiii.

p. 26. cap. xiii l. 19. DeCivitate Dei] lib. viii. cap. 12.

p. 27. l. 6. dechnassent] Note the passage here supplied by V. (rev. text,
pp. 28, 29), in which Bacon’s disregard for formal logie is illust1ated. (cl. vol ii.
p. 81, and Ο. Τ. cap. 28.)

p. ²7· l. 32. Boetius] V. has (revised text. p. 29) for pauca de aliis, pauca
Naturalia et aliquid de metaphysicalibus. Boethius is stated ina letter written
to him by Theodoric‚ preserved in Cassiodorus, to have translated many Greek
scientific works, notably those oi Euclid‚ Archimedes and Ptolemy. Among the
authors mentioned in this letter is Aristoteles logicus. Os Aristotle's Physics and
Metaphysics there is no mentiou; and certainly nothing was known of Aristotle
in Christian Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries, except the aliqua logicalia
oi which Bacon speaks. The pauca naturalia et aliquid de metaphysicalibus
may possibly be attributed to a Dominican who bore the name of Boetius. (See
Jourdain pp. 52-58.) ·
