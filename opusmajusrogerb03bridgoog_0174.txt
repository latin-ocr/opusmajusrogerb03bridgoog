p. 74. 1. 24. et seq.] The following points need notice. ln V. and J. the

Two forms of mem are given, spoken of as averte and close. Two forms of nun
and of tzadik, called respectively torte and dreite. Two forms of pe. Further,
tzadik precedes pc. (See p. 9ο, τ. t.)

p. 75. l 22. dabo] Here follows a passage written in Hebrew, and again in
Chaldaean. But in J. it was so inaccurately transcribed that it was omitted [τοττι
the printed text. In the revised text an exact copy of V. has been given, as will
be seen in the faesimiles from ff. 2 5, 16 of V. contained in this volume. Dr. S. A.
Hirsch, in his important article in the Jewislr Quarterly Revr'cw for October 1899,
“Early English Hebraists: Roger Bacon and his predecessors‚” has referred at
length to this passage, and to that given in p. 83 (p. 103 of r. t). 1 am
indebted to his kindness for the following note: “The vocalitation in the
Hebrew quotations is altogether faulty. It appears that the writer inserted the
points, not from a written copy, but in accordance with the sounds the trans·
literation attributed to them. Hence 'for τ, the transliteration of either being a ;
·· for a, transliteration 2 e ; 21 for ’2, transliteration :s,’' etc.
