174 ADDITIONAL NOTES, VOL I.

nationality, was prior of the abbey of Saint Victor 1162-1173. His treatise is in
Migne's collection. In lib. iii. cap. 14 he shows tlmt there must be two persons
for perfect happiness: three for perfect love. Mere duplication of the single
person isnotenough. Summus ille benignitatis gradus in divinitate locum non
haberet siin illa personarum pluralitate tertia persona deesset; et certe in sola
geminatione personae non esset cui posset quivis duorum praecipuas jucunditatis
suae delicias communicare. The discussion of the three proportions spoken ofin
the text will be found lib. v. cap. 14.

p. 224. l 21. Avenoes consentit] See f. 225b of ed. of ¹495 (Venice). He
represents the degree as 60 miles.

p. 231. l. 29. et hoc instrumentum] With these words the MS. J. stops
short; continuing with Musioalia‚ on last line of p. 236.

p. 234 l. 8. tota superficies solis] This calculation of the circumferenceand
of the surface of the sun is in hopeless disaccordance with the data given.
Assuming the sun's diameter to be 3 5941, this sum has been multiplied by three
with addition not septimae Μὰ, but ternae partis, to get 119803 as the circum·
ference. [The MSS. V. P. O. T. all have tertiae, an error which is not
committed in the other analogous calculatione] hlext, the multiplicatiori of the
figures representing diameter and circumference yields no such result as is given
in the text, but oue severity times less. The calculatione on pp. 226, 227 will
be found to be accurate, assuming the data from which Bacon starts

p. 240. l. ι 3. in libris magicis] Here J. has a remarkable variant: in libro
magico cujus titulus insanus est, scilicet, Theoria artis maginae, quam plures
mutaverunt in librum de Radiis, quia auctor illius libri multa praeclara praemittit
de radiorum multiplicatione quae physica sunt, ut magis alliciat animos legentium
ad venenum falsitatis quod principaliter intendit. Allicr'at refers to libro muga'co.
The book had mmcd the title of an innocent work of Bacon on a scientific
subject (Multr'plicatro specterum, otherwise T rectatus dc Radr'r's) in order to con-
ceal its pernicious tendency. Cf vol. ii pp. 407-8 (note) and Ο. T. p. 227.

p. 241. l. 7. damnant] With this word the MS. J. terminates.

p. 269. note 2. l. 3. For Cottonian MS. Jul. should be read Cottonian MS. Tib.
It should be added that this discussion of the Calendar is not contained in the
portion of Tib. C. v. which contains Part IV. of Opus Majus, but in the MS. of
Opus Tertium bound up in the same volume. Cf. Cott Tib. G v. ff. 4ob-43b.
The Lambeth MS. of part IV. also omits the section on the Calendar. lt is
contained however in V. and in P.

p. 274. l. 2¹·25· Et quoniam-Aprilis] This passage is omitted in V. and
P. The authority for it therefore is Op. Tert. as indicated in the above note.

p. 276. l. 1, 2. quia-horae] Omitted in V. and P.

p. 278. l. 28. dies 6940] Both V. and P. have here the same error, 69340.
There is a similar agreement in error on l. 363 XL. for quatuor. lt may be said
generally that in this section on the Calendar, V. and P. are in very close
agreement.

p. 281. l. 22-30. Et sicut—veritatem] Omitted in V. and l'. lt will he
found in Tib. f 42, b.

p. 2841. 16. lapide selenite] Bede‚ DeTemp. Rat. col. 482.

p. 288.1. 10. caeli] O. has caelestis, et coni isti suut diversi in natura et
