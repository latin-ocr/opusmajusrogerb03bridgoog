166 ADDITIONAL NOTES, VOL. I.

p. 55. l. 26. Michael Scoti] For an account of Scotus’ life and work, see
Jourdain pp. 124-134. Bacon’s expression, apparuit deferens partes aliquas etc..
is curious. In Compend. Studii (Brewer p. 472), Bacon says that though
Michael claimed these translations as his own, they were really made by a Jew
named Andrew. ln anycasesome of them, perhaps all, were very bad Albertus
Magnus confirms Bacon’s unfavourable judgment. ln his Comment. on Arist.
Meteor. he says, (lib. iii. tract iv. cap. 26) Michael scotus . . . in rei veritate
nescivit naturas, nec bene intellexit libros Aristotelis. Cf. vol. ii. p. 85 (nota).
Whether Scotus deserved the place allotted to him by Dante is another question.

p. 56. l. 8. assepbae] Kitab aletreta. according to Jourdain’s transliteration
tv· 388)-

p. 5⁶· cap. xiv. 1t will be seen that in the revised text the last chapter of Part
ii. (cap. xviii.) is here inserted. (p. 67, r. t). Further, the present chapter
is divided into two3 the division taking place (p. 581. ιι) Et similiter etc.
The present chapter, therefore, becomes cap. xv. and cap. xvi. ; cap xv. becomes
cap. xvii. 3 cap. xvi. cap. xviii. ; cap. xvii, which ends part ii.. becomes cap. xix.

p. 57. l. ro. Boetius] De disciplina scholarium cap. v.

p. 57. l. 22. nam ut in Moralibus] Much of this paragraph is repeated in
the first division of Part vii. cf. vol. ii. pp. 228-30. In the Metaphysics of
¹ Avicenna, especially in the ninth and tenth books, much is said of future rewards
and punishments‚ and of other doctrines here mentioned. The final chapter of lib.
x. is headed De eligendo successore et de summo sacerdote et de artibus et moribus.
Of such a man, when endowed with intellectual and moral virtue, he says, fortasse
fiet deus humanus quem licet adorare post Deum, quia ipse rex ‘terreni mundi cst
et est vicarius Dei in illo. (See however note 2 on p. 228, and note 2 on p. 230 of
vol. ii.) This version of Avicenna's Metaphysics, Venice 1498, isdescribed in the
colophon as optime castigata hy two theologians; who were perhaps inclined to
strain his language into accordance with Christian doctrine.

p. 58.l.13. ln testamento Patriarcharum] Matthew ,Paris (ad. ann. 1252)
mentions the discovery ol this work at Athens by John of Basingstoke, and its
translation from the Greek by Grosseteste. (Et should be supplied in the text after
Patriarcharum.) See Migne Patrol. Graeca, vol. xi. col. 1026-1159.

p. 38.l. 26. multum fundatur] De Civ. Dei, xviii. 38. Cf. xv. 23· The
reference is wrongly given both in Ο. and V.

p. 59. l. 1. recitat verba Esaiae] Avicenn. Metaph. x. 2.

p. 60. l. ς. imputato] erratum for impurato.

ρ. 6'0. 1. 13. metrice] See au boor of sibylline poems (eu. xroisius urach
pragae, 1891). As St. Augustine explains (De civ. Dei, xviii. 23), the initial
letters ol the Greek lines, when fully written, form the words Ἰησοῦς Χρειστὸς
Θεοῦ υἱὸς σωτὴρ, condensed, by again taking the initial letters, into the word ἰχθὺς;
in quo nomine mystice intelligitur' Christus, eoquod inhujus mortalitatis abysso
velut in aquarum profunditate vivus, hoc estsine peccato, esse potuerit. St.
Augustine gives an avowedly faulty rendering os the Greek verses into Latin.
And, moreover, the version is here quoted hy Bacon in a mutilated form destroy-
ing the acrostich.

p. 62. cap. xvii] In the revised text this chapter is cap. xix., and closes
Partii. (p 76, r. t.)
