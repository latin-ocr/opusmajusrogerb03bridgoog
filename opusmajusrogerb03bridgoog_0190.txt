ADDITIONAL NOTES, VOL. II. 183

complains frequently of the undue diffirsion of civil law. (Cf. Ο. Τ. ed. Brewer‚
P· 84-)

p. 2541. 14. After de Anima, M. has, et in radicibus moralis philosophiae
quod.

p. 254. l. 16. After majores, M. has, et propter hocin septimo Metaphysicae
vult Aristoteles quod bonum publicum est maJus et melius quam privatum.

· p. 261. l. 25. note (4). The reading of M. is imperfectly given 3 it is Militaris
viri pars est gloriae tolerantia adversitatum ; exempla gloriantur (et¹ seq. ).

p. 273. l. ις. transeunt . . . . et] The dots here, and in the numerous quota·
tions from Seneca that follow, are not to be understood as indicating a hiatus in 0.
They simply maan that Bacon left words or sentences unquoted. Words introduced
from Seneca to complete the sense bave been placed in brackets. See note on
p. 3⁶5 ; also add. note.

p. 287. l. 30. after libro secundo should follow : Et non solum se ipsos amittunt
sed proximos3 et non solum quos reputant inimicos dequibus planum est, sed
amicos. Nam, ut Seneca dicit libro secundo, Irati mortem liberis imprecantur,
amicissimis hostes vitandique carissimis. Dicit, Ira patri luctum, marito divortium
attulit, magistratui odium. Et magnifica ponit exempla quomodo in amicos
irruerunt.

p. 300. l. 1. After pugnat, O. has Ecce spectaculum dignum ad quod respiciat
intentus operi suo Deus. ·

p 3⁶5: ll. 5-9. This passage has needed much correction. Ο. and the Dublin
copy of Ο. read volens for volentis, intendatur animus vigorum for intendat animi
vigorem, and saltem for psalterium. In general 0., while very full of mistakes in

his readings of Seneca, appears to be accurate, and at any rate is usually intelligible, ·

in his rendering of Bacon ; the passage here referred to being a rare exception. With
regard to the Seneca quotations, it has been objected that 1 should have done better
to reproduce accurately the readings of the manuscript. They have been carefully
recorded by Mr. Herbert, and may be found useful hereafter, in the event of a
complete edition of Bacon’s works being contemplated. But the errors in the
Senem quotations are so numerous that to embody them in the text would have
made it in many places quite unintelligible. To determine how many are due to
Bacon’s copyist, how many to scribes of the fourteenth and fifteenth centurieS, would
hardly be possible. Bacon seems to have discovered these ‘dialogues,' perhaps by
Campano’s help, during the progress of his work. If so, the copy would have been
made hastily.

p. 377. l·. 4. fratres de domo Teutonica] Cf. what is said on this subject in
Part iii. (pp. rar-2 of revised text).

p. 407. l. 8. Primum igitur capitulum] Add. MS. 8786 contains on f. 20 b.
. col. 2 apreamble to this treatise, indicating its position as part of a larger philo-
sophicaf treatise. The two extracts here subjoined show its purport.

Postquam habitum est de principiis rerum naturalium, quaesunt materia et forma
et privatio potentiae activae et passivae, quae omnia sunt ordinata ad productionem
rerum naturalium et sunt a parte principii materialis, nunc dicendum est de hiis
quae consequuntur ordine naturali. Ad productionem vero rerum na(tura)lium de
potentia materiae patientis primo incurrit influentia agentis in hanc materiam, ut de
potentia talis materiae effectus naturales producantur. Et ideo oportet sciri
