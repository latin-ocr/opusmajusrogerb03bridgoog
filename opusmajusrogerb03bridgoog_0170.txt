ADDITJOML NOTES, VOL. l. 163

,has secunda distinctio. In J. fol. 83, on which this part began, is nearly destroyed.
See rev. text, p 36.

p. 33. l. 7. virtutem] quarumhasbeen omitted before virtutem.

p. 33. l. 8. una tamen] This shouldbeasin V., aut melius una est tantum.

p. 34. ll. 3, 4. siveram est] De doctr. Christiana, ii. 42. Neither in Ο. norin
V. is the passage correctly quoted. Augustine wrote, quicquid homo extra
didicerit, si noxium est, ibi damnatur 3 si utile est, ibi invenitur.

p. 34. l. 8. ad colossenses] col. 427 of Ambrose’s Commentary on th'ss
Epistle (ed. Migne). The quotation is very freely condensed frorn the original.

From this point onwards throughout part ii. the omissions in 0., as compared

with V., and, where possible, with J., become frequent andcopious, as will be
seen by reference to the revised text (hereafter noted as r. t. t.

p. 34. Cap. ii] Rubria preserved in J. z Capitulum secundum inquo ostenditur
propositum descendendo adjus canonicum. Cf. r. t. p. 37.

p. 34.l 24. non possumus dicere theologiam] This reading of Ο. is unintel-
ligible. J. is wholly wanting. In V. we have, non possumus dicere non
theologiam et scientiam juris canonici et philosophiam. lf esse be supplied after
theologam, the sense becomes more clear. The three are inseparable parts of one
whole.

p. 35. Cap. iii] Here the rubricis preserved inJ. Capitulum tertium inquo
ostenditur propositum descendendo ad philosophiam et hoc per Sententias
beati Augustini principaliter. V. in this chapter has twice the number of words
that are in Ο. 3 and the excess continues, though not in the same proportion,
throughout this part. It will be noted however that O. loses little of the meaning r
and as Bacon frequently tells us how he detested from'br'lr's prolixitas, it is not
impossible that at least part of this condensation may have taken place by his
orders, in his final draft. (Cf. r. t. p. 39.)

p. 36.1. 7. sicut Aegyptii] August, de Doct. Christ, lib. ii. cap. 28.

p. 36. l. 22. artium autern ceterarum] Ibid. cap. 25. cf. also cap. 39, 40.

p. 36. l. 3 ς. 'dicit Cassiodorus] Cf. p. 177, where this quotation isrepeated.
For an account of Cassiodorus' (or Cassiodorius’) encyclopedic work, De artibus ac
dr'sciplinis liberalium literamm, see Cantor, vol. i. pp. 481-4. See Migne‚ vol.
70, col. 1203-4.

p. 37. l. 12. si scripturas] See Jerome’s Ep. lxx. (sometimes numbered
lxxxiv.) addressed, Ad magnum oratorem urbis Romae. The quotation is given at
much greater length in V. and J. than in Ο.

p. 37, l. 21. Salomonem] Beda, de templo Salomonis, cap. 2.

p. 38. l. ις. impotens] This should be, in potentia.

p. 39.l. 32. soli Deo] Note the passage inserted from V. in r. t. p. 46.

p. 39. l. 35. et doctrinam] Here Ο. omits a yet longer passage, in which
the view that the intellectus agens is not pars animae is reinforced. The passage
is not transcribed correctly in V., and is erased inJ. But the meaning is fairly
clear, if in the sentence beginning Nam si unapars ejus, ‹yerod be omitted before
forma corporis, differentia or drffimm be substituted for dzfferrc, and pro actu for
peractum.

p. 40. l. 5. declarant] Here Ο. omits a long and interesting passage, in·
cluding the reference to William of Auvergne, Grosseteste and Adam hlarsh,
