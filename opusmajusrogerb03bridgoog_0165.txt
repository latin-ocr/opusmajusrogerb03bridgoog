ADDITIONAL NOTES.

VOLUME Ι.

p. xiii. l. 6. They have been] This sentence should begin: They have ¹been
collated with and in part recopied from those of a MS„ etc. It should be added
that fig. 47 is inaccurately drawn.

p. xiv. l. 22. These two MSS.] This should be: The unpublished parts of
these two MSS.

p. xv. l. rr. Jul and Tib. are spoken of in this supplement as J. and T.
Further remarks on these and other MSS. of which use has been made, will be
found in the Preface to this volume.

p. xxxiiil. 1. condemnation in 1277] Doubt has been thrown on the con·
demnation and imprisonment of Bacon on the ground that no earlier authority can
be found for it than that of Antoninus. But the following extract from the
Chronica xxiv Generalinm Ordinis Minorum (Assisi MS. 329, f. repa), which 1
owe to the kindness of M. Paul Sabatier‚ the discoverer and editor of the earliest
life of St. Francis, carries the authority at least a century further back than

Antoninus.
Hic Generalis frater Jeronimus de multorum fratrum consilio condempnavit et

reprobavit doctrinam Rogerii Bachonis Anglici sacre theologie magistri continentem
aliquas novitates suspectas propter quas fuit idem Rogerius carceri condempnatus
precipiendo omnibus fratribus ut nullus illam teneret sed ipsam vitaret ut per
ordinem reprobatam ; super hoc etiam scripsit Domino Pape Nicholao prefato ut
per eius auctoritatem doctrina illa periculosa totaliter sopiretur.

¹ Of this Chronica M. Sabatier remarks, ‘Ellea dte compos& sllrement dans la
premiere moitie du xtvm· siecle (puis continude jusqu’en 1374). Ge passage sur
Roger Bacon (¹09 a) a toutes les allures d' un extrait des Chroniques officielles de
l'ordre‚ tenues sans cesse djour (mais perdues pour cette epoque) et constamment
utilise'es par le compilateur de la Chron. xxiv. Gen.' Scepticism asto Bacon’s
imprisonment has no basis but the absence of any complaint from him in the
treatise (compendium theologiae) written after his release. He was then very old.
Whether religion or fear restrained him, we do not know ; but either would suffice
to explain his silence.

p. xciii. Analysis, chapter ii.] Abelard here printed by mistake for Adelard.

p. xcviii. -ix. chapter xiv.] The chapter marked in the text xviii should follow
chapter xiii; chapter xiv should be xv and xvi; and the other chapters should
follow3 the sectiou ending with chapter xvii. Cf. revised text as printed in this

supplementary volume.
